# Feedapp

This project is intended to show how you can use rxjs for handle animations, requesting data and updating and drawing data into the application.
Observables are a really powerful technology that can be use in many different ways.
### Features developed in this demo app:
- Get data from server and display a list
- Add feature to get data on an interval
- Add a drag-and-get-data feature.

All the above features where created using observables.

# Demo
[https://dist-akffsijeln.now.sh/](https://dist-akffsijeln.now.sh/): You'll need to open inspector and toggle the device view in order to use the drag functionality. The demo is intended to show how rxjs can be used more than just for manage state.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
